# Maximum-of-Modulo-opration

 Find the maximum value of A[ i ] % A[ j ] in a given array

Given an array A, find the maximum value of A[i] % A[j] from all possible pairs.

 Input:

    2

    3 5

where:

    First line represents the number of elements in the array.
    Second line represents elements in the array.
Output:

    3

Explanation: There are two possible pairs ( 3,5 ) and ( 5,3 )
so 3 % 5 = 3 and 5 % 3 = 2
maximum is 3
hence the output is 3.
